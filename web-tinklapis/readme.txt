During this exercise I was learning Scss language basics and how
to use variables writing this language. Also I learned hoe to write
style sheet code without using CSS frameworks. (All css comments
are in .scss file).


For responsive Menu I made two different types:
1. 'hover' type - pure css and html
2. 'click' type with jQuery toggleClass() function.
Also for the 'hamburger' menu icon I used SVG icon to make the page
load faster.

All in all this task wasn't so hard, but making it 'pixel perfect'
takes time.
I hope you will like my solution if the problem.
